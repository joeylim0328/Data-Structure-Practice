# Linked List
Linked list is a type of linear data structure similar to arrays. It is a collection of nodes that are linked with each other. Linked list can have a dynamic size, as elements can be added or removed easily without worrying about a fixed size (like an array).
The diagram below shows the structure of a simple linked list. A Node of a linked list contains a data item and a pointer `*next` which points to the next Node of a linked list. START points to the first Node of a linked list. The last node of the linked list will have its next pointer set as NULL since it will not point to any memory address.

# Operations
Unlike arrays, random access cannot be performed with a linked list. In order to access any Node, it needs to traverse the linked list from the start.

## Insertion
### Insert a Node at the beginning of the list
